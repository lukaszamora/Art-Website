Chile Verde
Serves: 4 to 6
Cook Time: 1 hr 30 min
Prep Time: 30 min

Ingredients:
* 3 Anaheim chiles
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into rough 1-inch chunks
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds
* 1 medium yellow onion, cut into small dice
* 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro with tender stems
* 6 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
* One 16-ounce can crushed tomatillos
* 4 cups chicken stock
* Tortilla chips and lime wedges, for serving

Steps:
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat the Anaheim chiles in
1 tablespoon of oil and roast in the oven until the skin blisters
and the peppers soften, about 20 minutes. Remove the chiles from
the oven and allow to cool. Once cooled, stem and seed the chiles, 
keeping the skin on (if there is some charring on the skin it's ok). 
Chop.
2. Heat the remaining oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.
Add the pork and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the cumin
and cook until the pork is golden brown all over, about 15
minutes, stirring as needed. Remove the pork with a slotted
spoon and set aside. Lower the heat to medium. Add the chiles,
onions, cilantro and garlic to the oil remaining in the pot.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Saute the vegetables, scraping
any brown bits from the bottom of the pot, until the onions
are soft and golden, about 10 minutes. Stir in the flour and
cook until the flour absorbs the excess liquid and is cooked
through, about 3 more minutes. Return the browned pork to the
pot along with the tomatillos and chicken stock. Bring to a
boil, reduce to a simmer and cover with the lid. Cook until
the pork is tender, about 45 minutes. Uncover and simmer until
the liquid reduces slightly and the flavors concentrate,
about 15 more minutes. Serve with tortilla chips and lime wedges.
